# The following patch(es) are ported from GeoffR's patch zips

Disable orphans/widows avoidance:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: Enable this patch to avoid blank lines at the bottom of pages in ePub books.
    # The default values of orphans:2; widows:2; cause extra blank lines to be added
    # to some pages to avoid leaving isolated lines of a paragraph at the top or
    # bottom of a page. Enabling this patch effectively forces orphans:1; widows:1;,
    # overriding the defaults and the book's stylesheet.
    #
    # Beware that this patch might(?) intefere with related CSS properties such as
    # page-break-after:avoid; or page-break-inside:avoid;. A better solution would
    # be to edit the book's stylesheet to set orphans:1; widows:1;.

Default ePub serif font:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
        This patch changes the default ePub serif font to Bitter.
        If the book's stylesheet specifies the generic 'font-family:serif;' then
            the ePub reader will try to use the built-in GUI system serif font
                (Georgia or 'Rakuten Serif').
            This is also the font you see if you select 'Publisher Default' from
            the Kobo [Aa] menu and your epub has not specified any particular font.
        This patch allows you to change the default to a different serif font 
            (built-in or sideloaded).
        N.B. This patch does not affect kepubs.

    # fw 4.32.19501: The font-family name in Replace: must now be the WHOLE name
    #                not just the first few characters of the name.
    #
    # To use a different font, change "Bitter" in each replacement string
    # to another font name (15 characters max).
    # For example, change "Rakuten%20Serif" to "Noto%20Serif" to use 
    #   a sideloaded 'Noto Serif' font.
    # The 3-char string, %20, represents a single space in the font-family name.
    #
    # If your new font name is longer than 15 chars you would need to:
    #   - Use a font editor to shorten the internal font-family name to <= 15 chars
    #   - Rename the 4 font filenames to match the new shortened name
    #   - Copy the 4 renamed font files into the Kobo sideloaded fonts folder
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "/normal/Rakuten%20Serif", Replace: "/normal/Bitter"}
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "/bold/Rakuten%20Serif", Replace: "/bold/Bitter"}
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "/italic/Rakuten%20Serif", Replace: "/italic/Bitter"}
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "/bolditalic/Rakuten%20Serif", Replace: "/bolditalic/Bitter"}

Default ePub sans-serif font:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch changes the default ePub sans-serif font to 'Noto Sans'.
      If the book's stylesheet specifies the generic 'font-family:sans-serif;' then
        the ePub reader will try to use the built-in GUI system sans-serif font 
        ('Avenir Next' or 'Rakuten Sans').
      This patch allows you to change the default to a different sans-serif font
        (built-in or sideloaded).
      N.B. This patch does not affect kepubs.

    # fw 4.32.19501: The font-family name in Replace: must now be the WHOLE name
    #                not just the first few characters of the name.
    # fw 4.34.20097: Kobo removed the 'Gill Sans' font files from the firmware. There is
    #       no longer a built-in sans-serif font with a name short enough to use in this patch.
    #       You can still use the patch with one of your sideloaded sans-serif fonts.
    # fw 4.34+: Kobo continue to revise the list of built-in fonts included in the firmware.
    #
    # To use a different font, change "Noto%20Sans" in each Replace: string
    #   to another font name (14 characters max).
    # For example, change "Noto%20Sans" to "Trebuchet" to use a sideloaded Trebuchet font.
    # The 3-char string, %20, represents a single space in the font-family name.
    #
    # If your new font name is longer than 14 chars you would need to:
    #   - Use a font editor to shorten the internal font-family name to <= 14 chars
    #   - Rename the 4 font filenames to match the new shortened name
    #   - Copy the 4 renamed font files into the Kobo sideloaded fonts folder

Force user line spacing in ePubs (Part 2 of 2):
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This is part 2 of 2. Also enable part 1 in libnickel.so.1.0.0.patch
      This patch prevents any line-height style set in the book's stylesheet from
      being recognised. It will spoil the formatting of some books, but will ensure
      that the line spacing set with the adjustment slider takes effect. (Unless
      the publisher has used the font shorthand style; see option below.)
  - FindBaseAddressString: "\0line-height\0"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 1, Find: "l", Replace: "_"}
    # Uncomment the following two lines to also prevent the font shorthand style
    # from being recognised. The font shorthand style is not very common in ePubs,
    # but where used it can also prevent the line spacing from being adjusted.
    # Beware that this option will likely have much bigger side-effects on the
    # book's formatting, because the font shorthand style is used to set the
    # font-size, font family, and other styles in addition to line-height.
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 1, Find: "f", Replace: "_"}
# - FindBaseAddressString: "\0font\0"

Force user font-family in ePubs (Part 2 of 2):
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This is part 2 of 2. Also enable part 1 in libnickel.so.1.0.0.patch
      This patch prevents any font-family style set in the book's stylesheet from
      being recognised. It might spoil the style of books which use multiple fonts,
      but will ensure that the font-family set from the device menu takes effect.
      (Unless the publisher has used the font shorthand style; see option below.)
  - FindBaseAddressString: "\0font-family\0"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 1, Find: "f", Replace: "_"}
    # Uncomment the following two lines to also prevent the font shorthand style
    # from being recognised. The font shorthand style is not very common in ePubs,
    # but where used it can also prevent the font-family from being adjusted.
    # Beware that this option will likely have much bigger side-effects on those
    # book's formatting, because the font shorthand style is used to set the
    # font-size, line-height, and other styles in addition to font-family.

Ignore ePub book Adobe XPGT stylesheet (page-template.xpgt):
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Not all ePubs have an Adobe XPGT stylesheet, and the ones that do often use
      it mainly to set the page margins. Unfortunately those margins are added to
      the page margins set via @page in the CSS stylesheet, and cannot be overidden
      by the `ePub fixed/ajustable top/bottom margins` patch.
      This patch should cause any Adobe XPGT stylesheet in the book to be ignored,
      but for the book's CSS stylesheet still to be used as normal.
      (You might prefer to remove the margins from the book's XPGT stylesheet
      before sideloading, instead of using this patch. Calibre's Modify ePub plugin
      has a useful option for doing this.)
  - FindBaseAddressString: "\0template\0"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 1, Find: "t", Replace: "_"}

# The following two patches will not be useful to most people, don't enable them unless you are sure you need them.
Ignore ePub book CSS and Adobe XPGT stylesheets:
  - Enabled: no
  - FindBaseAddressString: "\0stylesheet\0"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 1, Find: "s", Replace: "_"}
  - FindBaseAddressString: "\0style-sheet\0"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 1, Find: "s", Replace: "_"}

Ignore ePub TOC navpoints:
  - Enabled: no
  - FindBaseAddressString: "\0navPoint\0"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 1, Find: "n", Replace: "_"}
